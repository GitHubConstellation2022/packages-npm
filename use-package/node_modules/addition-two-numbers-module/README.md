This repository can be used as a reference guide/sample to enable publishing your first package via npm registry.

## :mega: Prerequisites

- A [npmjs account](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-new-npm-user-account) with a verified e-mail address
- Basic understanding of software package registries (e.g. GitHub Packages, npm)

## Steps for Getting started
### 1. Setup a Project: Setting up a project is required before doing anything.

* Install Node.js
```
1. Go to the [Node.js Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download Node.js for macOS by clicking the "Macintosh Installer" option
3. Run the downloaded Node.js .pkg Installer
4. Run the installer, including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install.
5. You're finished! To ensure Node.js has been installed, run node -v in your terminal - you should get something like v6.9.4
```

* Create an npm account.
```
https://www.npmjs.com/signup
```

* Logging in to the npm account using `npm login`

```
âžœ  sample-npm-publish git:(main) âœ— npm login

```

### 2. Initializing a package is required before publishing using `npm init`

```
âžœ  sample-npm-publish git:(main) âœ— npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

}


Is this OK? (yes) yes
```

### ### 3.  Building a package is required before publishing

Lets first implement a simple function that add two numbers in the npm module. This function looks like below:

File Name: index.js

```
const addFns = {
  add : function addTwoNums( num1, num2 ) {
    return (num1 + num2) ;
  }
}
  
module.exports = addFns
```

### 4. Publishing a package is required before publishing using `npm publish`

To check if your package name is usable or not, go to the command-line and type `npm search addition-two-numbers-module`

```
âžœ  sample-npm-publish git:(main) âœ— npm search addition-two-numbers-module
No matches found for "addition-two-numbers-module"
```

Now after checking the name availability, go to command-line/terminal and type `npm publish`

```
