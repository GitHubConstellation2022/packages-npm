This repository can be used as a reference guide/sample to enable publishing your first package via npm registry.

## :mega: Prerequisites

- A [npmjs account](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-new-npm-user-account) with a verified e-mail address
- Basic understanding of software package registries (e.g. GitHub Packages, npm)

## Steps for Getting started
### 1. Setup a Project: Setting up a project is required before doing anything.

* Install Node.js
```
1. Go to the Node.js Downloads page https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download Node.js for macOS by clicking the "Macintosh Installer" option
3. Run the downloaded Node.js .pkg Installer
4. Run the installer, including accepting the license, selecting the destination, and authenticating for the install.
5. You're finished! To ensure Node.js has been installed, run node -v in your terminal - you should get something like v6.9.4
```

* Create an npm account.
```
https://www.npmjs.com/signup
```

  <img src="./images/signup.png" width="250" title="hover text">
</p>

* Logging in to the npm account using `npm login`

```
âžœ  packages-npm git:(main) âœ— npm login
npm notice Log in on https://registry.npmjs.org/
Username: nishgupta
Password:
Email: (this IS public) nishantgupta.cs@gmail.com
npm notice Please use the one-time password (OTP) from your authenticator application
Enter one-time password: 465775
Logged in as nishgupta on https://registry.npmjs.org/.
```

### 2. Initializing a package is required before publishing using `npm init`

```
âžœ  packages-npm git:(main) âœ— npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

}


Is this OK? (yes) yes
```

### 3.  Building a package is required before publishing

Lets first implement a simple function that add two numbers in the npm module. This function looks like below:

File Name: index.js

```
const addFns = {
  add : function addTwoNums( num1, num2 ) {
    return (num1 + num2) ;
  }
}
  
module.exports = addFns
```

### 4. Publishing a package is required before publishing using `npm publish`

To check if your package name is usable or not, go to the command-line and type `npm search addition-two-numbers-module`

```
âžœ  packages-npm git:(main) âœ— npm search addition-two-numbers-module
No matches found for "addition-two-numbers-module"
```

Now after checking the name availability, go to command-line/terminal and type `npm publish`

```
âžœ  packages-npm git:(main) âœ— npm publish
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  addition-two-numbers-module@0.0.0

### 5. Use this package

* Make a fresh project directory.

```
âžœ  packages-npm git:(main) âœ— mkdir use-package
âžœ  packages-npm git:(main) âœ— cd use-package
```

* In the terminal, type `npm init` to initialize the Node project.

```
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Is this OK? (yes)
```

* Now do `npm install addition-two-numbers-module` to download the npm module that we just made.

```
âžœ  use-package git:(main) âœ— npm install addition-two-numbers-module

added 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 2s

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

* Add new file `app.js` to import the npm module and use it.

```
const addFns = require('addition-two-numbers-module');

const c= addFns.add(1,2);
console.log(c);
```

* Now everything is set, lets try to run node.js file and see if our module is correctly uploaded, published, imported in our new project, and used.

```
âžœ  use-package git:(main) âœ— node app.js

```
